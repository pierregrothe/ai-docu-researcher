        - `url`: The full URL.
        - `title`: The page title.
        - `credibility_score`: An integer from 1 (very untrustworthy) to 10 (highly authoritative).
        - `justification`: A brief explanation for your score (e.g., "Primary source from museum," "Well-respected industry publication," "Anonymous user forum, low credibility").
    4.  Return a single JSON list of these dictionaries, ranked from highest to lowest credibility score.
